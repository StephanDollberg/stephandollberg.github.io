My name is Stephan Dollberg. I am a Master student in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology. My main interest is in programming and software development.

Language-wise I code in C++, Python and Go. My favorite topics are in the areas of systems engineering such as concurrency, networking and security. I am interested in the technologies that make up the web, as well. I am also a member of the gn00bz CTF team.

Think Big,

Stephan
