I am a Master student in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology. My main interest is in programming and software development.

Language-wise I love C++ and Python. My favorite topics are in the areas of systems engineering such as concurrency, networking and security. Recently, I start to enjoy Go.

I am also interested in the technologies that make up the web.

Think Big,

Stephan
