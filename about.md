My name is Stephan Dollberg. I am a Software Engineer at G-Research. I am most passionate about building software that works.

I mostly code in C++, Rust, Python and Go. My main areas of interest are in systems engineering, such as concurrency, networking or simply optimizing data structures and algorithms.

Security is another field that I am keen about, especially topics related to the web. I am a member of the gn00bz/flagbot CTF team.

Think Big,

Stephan
