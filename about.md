My name is Stephan Dollberg. I am a Software Engineer at G-Research. I am most passionate about building software that works efficiently.

I mostly language agnostic though mostly versed in C++ and very interested in Rust. My main areas of interest are in systems programming, such as concurrency, networking or optimization.

A long time ago I was also quite into security and participated in CTFs mostly focusing on security on the web.

Think Big,
Stephan
