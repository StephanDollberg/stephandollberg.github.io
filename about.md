My name is Stephan Dollberg. I am a Master student in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology. I am most passionate about building software that works.

I mostly code in C++, Python and Go. My main areas of interest are in systems engineering such as concurrency, networking or simple optimization of data structures and algorithms. I am also keen on security, especially topics related to the web. I am a member of the gn00bz CTF team.

Think Big,

Stephan
